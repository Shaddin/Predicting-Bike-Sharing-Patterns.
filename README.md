# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns.
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree, First Project.

Using only Numpy to carry out forward and back propagation for prediction of Bike-Sharing Patterns and the goal is to build a neural network from scratch and applying them to solve real prediction problems.

"Time to build the network
Below you'll build your network. We've built out the structure. You'll implement both the forward pass and backwards pass through the network. You'll also set the hyperparameters: the learning rate, the number of hidden units, and the number of training passes.

The network has two layers, a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation function is  𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥 . A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes into account the threshold, is called an activation function."
