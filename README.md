# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns.

Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree, First Project;

Using only Numpy to carry out forward and back propagation for prediction of Bike-Sharing Patterns and the goal is to build a neural network from scratch and applying them to solve real prediction problems.

"The network has two layers, a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation function is  𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥 . A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes into account the threshold, is called an activation function."

# Conclusion

 As shown above, in the figure on Dec 21 the prediction deviated and that may due to lack of samples in the training set for the holiday in contrast weekdays.
